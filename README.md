<h1>HLADM</h1>
Half-Life: Alyx: Deathmatch
<hr>
<p>Currently, this is more focused on the Non-VR aspect of things, however I may add a officially VR supported mode in the future</p>
<p>The goal of this is to recreate HL2DM in the HLA Engine/S2</p>
<p>One of the issues with HLA's code is much of it is singleplayer only, therefore making some things unstable</p>
<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>Install Jan4V's Non-VR Patch (now fixes dedicated servers like mine did)</p>
<p>Download this resporitory, and drag and drop hladm into YourSteamappsDir\Half-Life Alyx\game</p>
<p>Make a shortcut to your hlnonvr.exe with the launch options: -game hladm -console -vconsole -developer -dev</p>
<p>OR FOR HOSTING OF A DEDICATED SERVER:</p><p> -game hladm -dedicated -allow_no_lobby_connect -maxplayers 16 -tickrate 64</p>

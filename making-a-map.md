<h1>Making a map!</h1>
<p>To make a map for HLADM, you must follow these guidelines</p>
<br>
<p>Make sure the following models are in the map(I recommend you put them in the middle of nowhere)</p>
<ul>
  <li>models/creatures/vortigaunt/vortigaunt_tunnels.vmdl</li>
  <li>models/characters/alyx/alyx.vmdl</li>
  <li>models/characters/hazmat_worker/hazmat_worker.vmdl</li>
  <li>models/characters/eli/eli_end.vmdl</li>
  <li>models/characters/eli/eli.vmdl</li>
  <li>models/characters/combine_grunt/combine_grunt.vmdl</li>
   <li>models/characters/larry/larry.vmdl</li>
  <li>models/characters/metrocop/metrocop_choreo.vmdl</li>
</ul>
<p>(for precaching reasons, if you don't do this players models will not load)</p>
<hr>
<h1>I PLAN TO EXPAND THIS LATER ON!</h1>
<p>These map guidelines will be changing a lot during development!</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p> And that's it! If your map is good enough, it'll get officially added into HLADM!</p>
